<p> This article goes over some steps you can take to debloat your windows installation.</p>

<p>First off if you ever need to reinstall your windows; you don't need to go through the process of debloating everytime. Visit my <a href="https://retr0680.github.io/retr0OS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debloated version</a> of windows to be clean out of the box.</p>
<h3>Bloatware Removal</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo-uninstaller-free-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revo Uninstaller</a> is a great tool to remove bloatware from your system. It has a free version that works well for most users.</p>
<p>Once you install and run the application; select options at the top and apply these settings for the most simplified uninstall process.</p>

<p>Now if you'd like to make a restore point, now is the time to do so before we do the actual debloating</p>
<p>Afterwards, to start debloating, double click on what you'd like to uninstall. It may take a few seconds to load, but the uninstaller should appear, and after uninstallation you'll come to see the ability to scan; I would recommend selecting advanced then hitting Scan.</p>

<p>After scanning it may come up with leftover registry keys you can remove, they should all be selected already so you only need to hit Delete</p>

<p>Not always, but sometimes leftover files will be there too which you will also have the option to Delete</p>

<h4>That's it!</h4>
<p>Go through your entire list and uninstall old games or apps that you don't use or don't use often, target preinstalled bloat that you don't use. And lastly, don't forget to visit the 'Windows App' tab at the top to debloat from there as well</p>
<p>Ensure you know what you're deleting before deleting. </p>
