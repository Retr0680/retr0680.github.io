<p>Hey! I’m Retr0 well, that’s what most people know me as. My real name exists somewhere, but online I go by Retr0.</p>

<p>My journey into tech and optimizations started way before I knew what a registry tweak even was. The first game I ever played was GTA Vice Cite on my brothers PC. That game still holds a special place in my heart. Eventually, I branched out into Project IGI, Call of duty Black ops 3.</p>

<p>These games were my rotation until Fortnite dropped. I’ve been playing nearly since the beginning on PS4 Slim, but it didn’t take long before I upgraded(?) to my first Laptop. I say “upgraded” loosely—this piece of shit had a i3 7020U with integrated graphics. I was a goated player despite running Fortnite at sub-60 FPS. But either way, the lag and stutter? Not it.</p>

<p>That’s when I went full rabbit hole into PC optimizations. I watched everyone I could find, but the one who really stood out after some time was AdamX. Back when he was on the rise, his videos were everything. If you know, you know. He had way more content than what’s left online as of today (most are deleted now), and I was glued to every upload.</p>

<p>Eventually, I got some upgrades, locked in a stable 144 FPS, and became the go-to tech fixer among my (singular) friend.</p>


<p>Thanks for checking out the site, and for getting to know the guy behind the screen. Whether you’re here to optimize your rig or just curious, I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
