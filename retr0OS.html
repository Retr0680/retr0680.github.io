  <p>Install Link Coming Soon: Always will be free</p>
  <p>Changelog Coming Soon</p>

<h3>How do you make these custom configured installations</h3>
<p>Through a program called NTLite, it provides me access to changing the installation features within an iso file.</p>
<p>You can do things such as...
  <ul>
    <li>Add to the registry</li>
    <li>Remove Components/Bloat</li>
    <li>Turn on/off Services</li>
    <li>Run scripts on first startup</li>
    <li>Plus more!</li>
  </ul>
