<div style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 30px;">
  <h3>Debloated Win 11 23h2</h3>
  <p>This is the operating system that I use for testing purposes; it has no tweaks applied to it whatsoever. It is simply debloated with a more simplified installation process.</p>
  <p>Install Link Coming Soon: Always will be free</p>
  <p>Changelog Coming Soon</p>
</div>

<div style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 30px;">
  <h3>Optimized Win 11 23h2</h3>
  <p>This system will be based off of the one above, but will include optimizations verified by myself</p>
  <p>Install link is far from coming; but will also be free</p>
  <p>Changelog Coming Soon</p>
</div>
  
<p>If you would like to support me though, you can do so by spreading this website and articles to others.</p>
